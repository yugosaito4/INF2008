> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. The features are already extracted in the 'Features' folder
> 2. Re-Running  `extraction.py` will override the exisiting feature parquet file. Change the file path for *CK+/FER2013* set
> 3. Latest Logging details of the model training which includes the confusion matrix is in the 'Logging' folder
> 4. Weighted SVM model is tuned for FER2013 set while SVM is for CK+ Dataset
